Data Engineering Landscape
Data Engineering focuses on building and maintaining systems that collect, store, and process large amounts of data efficiently. It forms the backbone of modern data-driven organizations, ensuring that data is reliable, clean, and available for analysis and decision-making.

There are several core concepts in data engineering. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) refers to the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and then loading it into a data warehouse. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is a similar process, but the data is first loaded into the target system and then transformed there, which is common in cloud-based environments. Data pipelines are automated workflows that move and process data from one system to another. A data warehouse is a central repository optimized for storing structured data, while a data lake stores large volumes of raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data. Orchestration involves managing and scheduling these workflows using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to ensure they run reliably and efficiently.

In their day-to-day work, data engineers design, build, and manage the infrastructure that supports data processing. They create and maintain data pipelines, develop ETL or ELT processes, and ensure that data is accurate and up to date. They also optimize data storage systems, monitor data workflows, and work closely with data analysts and scientists to make data accessible and useful. Data engineers are responsible for ensuring that all data systems are scalable, efficient, and secure, supporting the overall analytics and machine learning goals of the organization.
