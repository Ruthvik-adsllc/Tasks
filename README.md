Data Engineering Landscape
Data Engineering focuses on building and maintaining systems that collect, store, and process large amounts of data efficiently. It forms the backbone of modern data-driven organizations, ensuring that data is reliable, clean, and available for analysis and decision-making.

There are several core concepts in data engineering. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) refers to the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and then loading it into a data warehouse. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is a similar process, but the data is first loaded into the target system and then transformed there, which is common in cloud-based environments. Data pipelines are automated workflows that move and process data from one system to another. A data warehouse is a central repository optimized for storing structured data, while a data lake stores large volumes of raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data. Orchestration involves managing and scheduling these workflows using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to ensure they run reliably and efficiently.
